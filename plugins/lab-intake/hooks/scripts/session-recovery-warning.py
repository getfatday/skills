"""SessionStart uncommitted-capture warning (lab-intake).

Committed history is the durability floor: a committed raw file or fragment
wiped by any command restores byte-identical via `git checkout <sha> -- <path>`,
but an UNCOMMITTED capture that gets destroyed is gone forever — between
creation and its capture commit, a file is one Bash command from unrecoverable.
This hook prints one warning line naming uncommitted files under the raw and
journal-fragment directories so the session commits them first.

Advisory only: never blocks, fails open on any error, always exits 0. Silent
when git is unavailable, the directory is not a repository, or everything
under the guarded directories is committed.
