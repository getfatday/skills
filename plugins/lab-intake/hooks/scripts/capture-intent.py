"""UserPromptSubmit capture-intent detector (lab-intake).

Deterministic, zero-network, stdlib-only: reads the prompt (hook JSON or raw
text on stdin), emits at most one line of additionalContext when the user is
asking to save/note/record knowledge, and always exits 0.

Precision-first: a missed nudge costs nothing (the intake skill's own
description still triggers the skill), while a false one adds noise — so
discourse and operational phrasings are explicitly excluded. This nudge is an
interactive-session reinforcement only; the durable enforcement lives in the
PreToolUse guard and the consumer's settings deny rules.
