"""SessionStart ledger resolver (v5: the decision store + the three-shape
normalizer over the v4 four-kind resolver).

PROVENANCE — port of the source lab's hooks/session_resolver.py v5 (kept lineage
H-088 -> H-095 -> H-101 -> H-105, decision store joined 2026-08-28 under the
consolidated decision-making directive). Differences from the lab copy: the
shared closes_when.py loads from the consumer repo's scripts/ first and then
from this plugin's own scripts/ (same evaluator, so the resolver and the
compiled dashboard can never disagree on open/closed), and a one-argument AUTO
mode (`session_resolver.py <repo_root>`) derives the ledger / hypotheses /
operating-model paths from .claude/crux.json + the crux defaults for hook
wiring. The 3-, 4-, and 5-argument CLI and all resolution semantics are
identical to the lab copy.

v5 additions (docs/decisions.md sections 5-6) -- everything below this block is the v4
text, unchanged where it still applies:
  - THREE-shape read: legacy {date,slug,hit,kind} rows unchanged; v2
    {kind,id,date,text,closes_when} rows normalize as slug := id, hit := text +
    " [closes-when: <closes_when>]" (the 12 live v2 rows stop being warned as malformed);
    kind:"decision" / kind:"decision-resolution" rows join the decision store. LEDGER-WARN
    now fires only for truly-bad lines (unparseable JSON, or none of the three shapes).
  - Open-decision surfacing, printed FIRST after the read-pass warnings (the hook pipes
    through `head -20`; decisions are the top surface): one line per open decision --
        DECISION-LEDGER\t<id>\t<urgency>\t<title>\t<blocks>
    ordered urgency (high first) then oldest ask, followed by ONE summary line --
        DECISIONS-OPEN\t<count>\toldest <id> <age>d
    A decision is open iff no accepted|denied resolution row joins its id (a comment row
    stays open). Ages use the wall clock (this is a live session surface, not a compiled
    artifact); pin with DECISIONS_TODAY=YYYY-MM-DD for deterministic tests. No decision
    rows -> not even the summary line prints: a decision-free legacy-only ledger keeps
    v4's byte-identical output (regression lock preserved).
  - decision-resolved=<id> reaches commitment rows through the shared closes_when.py
    (scripts/closes_when.py carries the predicate; this file's commitment machinery is
    unchanged).

Original v4 header:

Built from hypotheses/H-105-directive-net.md and
experiments/runs/H-105/fixture/directive-intake-design.md S3 (resolver v4's `directive` kind
contract) ONLY, extending the KEPT H-101 v3 resolver (hooks/session_resolver.py) verbatim for
all pre-existing behavior -- typed records: intent + amendment + commitment. Per directive 8
(train/test separation), never saw any label set, seeder, or manifest for this or any prior
resolver hypothesis.

Usage (UNCHANGED CLI from v3 -- no new argv position; design doc S3: "No new argv --
directives dir derives from repo_root"):
    session_resolver_v4.py <ledger_path> <hypotheses_dir> [operating_model_dir] [repo_root]

argv[4] (repo_root) is OPTIONAL, exactly as in v3. Calling with the original 2 or 3 arguments
reproduces v3's (and, transitively, H-088's/H-095's) kept behavior byte-for-byte (regression
lock): a ledger with no "kind":"directive" records resolves identically either way, and any
"kind":"directive" record present under a 2-arg or 3-arg call surfaces as unresolved
(repo_root absent -> safe default, the same rule already applied to amendment/commitment).

Ledger records are JSON objects, one per line: {"date", "slug", "hit"} plus an OPTIONAL "kind".
"kind" absent => "intent" (backward compatible with every H-088 ledger). Supported kinds are
now "intent", "amendment", "commitment", "directive"; any other kind value makes the line
malformed.

Resolution predicate, per kind:
    intent      slug substring-matches some H-*.md filename under <hypotheses_dir>. UNCHANGED
                from H-088/H-095/v3.
    amendment   slug substring-matches the CONTENTS of some file found by a recursive walk of
                <operating_model_dir>. UNCHANGED from H-095/v3: absent/unlistable dir -> every
                amendment record unresolved.
    commitment  resolved iff repo_root is given AND the record's "hit" carries a valid
                "[closes-when: <predicate>=<arg>]" bracket AND that predicate is satisfied
                against repo_root. repo_root absent, or the bracket missing/malformed in hit,
                -> unresolved. UNCHANGED from v3 (H-101), including the closes_when.py load
                path and the level-triggered backstop-suppression fix -- see is_resolved_commitment
                and is_stale_backstop below, both untouched.

    directive   NEW in v4 (design doc S3). resolved iff repo_root is given AND
                <repo_root>/directives/ is listable AND the slug substring-matches the
                CONTENTS of some file matching <repo_root>/directives/D-*.md (a flat listdir,
                not a recursive walk -- design doc S3: "recursive walk not needed -- flat
                dir"). Contents-match, not filename-match -- design doc S1/S3: directive slugs
                are long derived spans that would make filenames absurd, the same reason
                amendment resolution is contents-match rather than filename-match. repo_root
                absent, or directives/ missing/unlistable, -> every directive record
                unresolved (the same safe default amendment already uses for a missing model
                dir; never crashes, never guesses).

Prints, oldest first ACROSS ALL FOUR KINDS (stable sort by "date"; ties keep each record's
original position in the ledger file), one line per unresolved, well-formed record:

    INTENT-LEDGER\t<date>\t<slug>\t<hit>          (kind == "intent")
    AMENDMENT-LEDGER\t<date>\t<slug>\t<hit>        (kind == "amendment")
    COMMITMENT-LEDGER\t<date>\t<slug>\t<hit>       (kind == "commitment")
    DIRECTIVE-LEDGER\t<date>\t<slug>\t<hit>        (kind == "directive", NEW in v4)

Resolved entries are silent. Each malformed line (invalid JSON; not a JSON object; missing
"date"/"slug"/"hit"; or a "kind" value that is none of the four supported kinds) is skipped
with exactly one warning, printed immediately during the read pass -- so warnings precede the
(oldest-first) report, in file order:

    LEDGER-WARN\tskipped malformed line <n>

Never raises; always exits 0. An empty or missing ledger prints nothing. Stdlib only (the
closes_when.py load is a plain-file import attempt, still stdlib-only machinery -- importlib).

Regression lock (design doc S3 / H-NET assertion 5): with a ledger containing no "directive"
rows, this file's output is byte-identical to v3's under 2-, 3-, 4-, and 5-arg calls -- the
new load_directive_contents() call happens unconditionally (mirroring how om_contents is
already loaded unconditionally), but its result only ever feeds is_resolved_directive(),
which is only ever consulted for kind == "directive" rows. With none present, that extra load
has zero effect on output.
