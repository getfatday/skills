"""PreToolUse write-once guard (crux).

Deterministic deny rules:
  - Edit/NotebookEdit anywhere under the raw directory: always denied — raw
    sources are never edited after creation.
  - Write under the raw directory: denied only when the target already exists,
    so write-once creation stays legal (shell heredoc creation is likewise
    untouched on this path).
  - The same shape over the journal fragments directory: fragments are
    write-once entries; past entries are never rewritten.
  - Edit/Write/NotebookEdit on the base journal file: always denied — it is
    append-only history, and new entries are fragments.
  - Bash: a mistake-net branch parses the command string and denies plain
    destructive forms aimed at an EXISTING file under the raw or fragment
    directories — rm/unlink/shred/truncate, mv (rename-away or overwrite),
    cp onto, git rm/mv, truncating redirection (>, >|, &>), in-place editors
    (sed -i, perl -i), tee without -a, and interpreter one-liners that name
    the path with a write call. Creation onto new paths, tee -a, reads, >>
    appends, and `git checkout <sha> -- <path>` recovery are never matched.

The Bash branch is a mistake-net, not a security boundary: command-string
inspection cannot be exhaustive (substitution, xargs, scripts, cwd games all
evade it). It targets the plain-text commands a colleague types by mistake;
durability against everything else is the committed-recovery floor plus a
pushed remote, not this net.

Fails open on any error: a crashing PreToolUse hook would block every tool
call, which is worse than a missed deny. The consumer's settings deny rules
(written by init) are the durability layer when this plugin is disabled.
