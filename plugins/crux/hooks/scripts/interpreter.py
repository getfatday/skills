"""Generic PreToolUse policy interpreter (crux) — deny + advisory paths.

Reads the consumer repository's operating-model policy nodes as data
(operating-model/policies/*.md and operating-model/*/policies/*.md): the
node file IS the configuration; enforcement changes are node-file edits,
never code changes.

Rule table:

  - enforcement: hook (exact) + mechanism block WITHOUT action: -> deny
    path (rule 3): exit 2, stderr reason.
  - action: advise (any enforcement value) OR enforcement: advisory + block
    with action absent -> advise path (rule 4): on match, collect one
    line "ADVISORY <node-id>: <message>".
  - The advise path never affects the exit code (rule 5 — the
    no-hard-block honesty guarantee): all matches collected, printed to
    stdout sorted by node id, deduplicated; exit stays 0 unless a deny-path
    node (rule 3) matched.
  - action: deny (explicit) is honored only when enforcement: hook backs it,
    then behaves exactly like rule 3 (rule 6).
    The key exists so a future edit can flip a node advisory -> deny by
    editing the node file alone. A
    node that asks for action: deny without enforcement: hook is a
    self-contradictory honesty-rule violation (an advisory may never
    escalate itself to a guaranteed block via a stray key) — warn-and-skip,
    not a silent block and not a silent downgrade.
  - Malformed mechanism content — scalar mechanism (rule 2), non-list
    deny-tools/deny-paths/exclude-paths, a non-scalar
    message, or an unknown action value (rule 7) — warn-and-skip on
    stderr, never crash: a crashing
    PreToolUse hook blocks every tool call.
  - Bad stdin JSON -> exit 1 (rule 8, unchanged).

Only PreToolUse is interpreted (mechanism `event:`, default when absent);
other event values are silently ignored — the key reserves the extension
point (Stop/SessionStart policies).
