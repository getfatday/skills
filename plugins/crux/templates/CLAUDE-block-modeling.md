## Knowledge intake

This repository captures knowledge through the crux plugin's `intake` skill (adapted
from the ingest flow in Karpathy's LLM Wiki pattern): every piece of knowledge lives in exactly
one right place, is as small as it can be, is linked so it can be found, and is journaled so its
arrival is traceable.

| Path | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `{{RAW_DIR}}/` | Immutable verbatim sources. Write once, never edit; distill into notes |
| `{{NOTES_DIR}}/` | Distilled self-reference notes; studies live next to the index |
| `{{INDEX_FILE}}` | Catalog of the wiki layer — one line per page, updated on every capture |
| `{{JOURNAL_DIR}}/` | Append-only journal: one write-once fragment file per entry; compiled view via `scripts/compile-journal.py` |

### Capture rule

Any new knowledge or agent self-reference file enters through the `intake` skill's process:

0. **Raw first** — verbatim human or external input lands untouched in
   `{{RAW_DIR}}/<date>-<slug>.md` with a provenance header before distilling. Raw files are
   never edited after creation.
1. **Right place** — put it in the directory that owns that kind of content.
2. **Minimal** — smallest useful content; no speculative sections.
3. **Linked** — reference it from a relevant existing doc and add one line to `{{INDEX_FILE}}`.
4. **Journaled** — add one write-once fragment under `{{JOURNAL_DIR}}/` (frontmatter `id:`
   monotonic, `date:`; no author names — git blame is attribution) noting what was added and why.
5. **Committed** — one commit per capture, authored by the capturer, containing exactly that
   capture's files plus the refreshed `DASHBOARD.md` when the capture changed what it
   projects. The (commit sha, author email) pair is the capture's id; until the commit lands
   the capture is one Bash command from unrecoverable.

New write-once files (raw files, journal fragments) are created via a Bash `tee` heredoc: the
settings deny protects existing records; creation flows through `tee`.

### Identity is git's job, and the name rule is scoped

Raw bodies stay **verbatim** even when the material names its own speaker — the name is part
of the record, and identity resolves through the header's `captured-by:` plus the landing
commit. Everything you *author* rather than transcribe — distilled notes, the index line, the
journal fragment, `DASHBOARD.md`, and your commit subject and body — carries no display names:
refer to people by canonical email or not at all. Display names live only in a committed
`contributors.json` at the repo root; do not copy one out of it into anything else.

## Experiment loop

Testable ideas about ways of working run through the crux plugin's `hypothesis` skill
(adapted from, not identical to, Karpathy's autoresearch): spec first, one variable, fixed
budget, binary assertions, mechanical verdict, journaled always.

| Path | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `{{HYPOTHESES_DIR}}/` | One spec per hypothesis: `H-NNN-<slug>.md`, created from `{{TEMPLATE_FILE}}` |
| `{{RUNS_DIR}}/<id>/` | Run artifacts: pinned shared inputs in `fixture/`, per-run outputs in `run-<k>/` |
| `{{PREFLIGHT_FILE}}` | Deterministic spec pre-flight; exit 0 = run-ready |

### Experiment rules

- Every experiment declares 3-5 binary pass/fail assertions BEFORE running. No subjective
  scores.
- One variable per experiment. If a design changes two things, split it into two hypotheses.
- Run the smallest experiment that can falsify the hypothesis; specs follow the template —
  nothing beyond its sections.
- Every run has a fixed budget declared in the spec; halt on breach and record the run as
  budget-exceeded.
- The verdict is keep / discard / refine, decided mechanically from the assertions — never
  from impressions.
- An experiment is done only when its journal fragment records assertions, results, and
  verdict (journal fragments are the capture layer's write-once convention).
- Surgical scope: an experiment touches only its own spec, its run directory, and its journal
  fragment — never other hypotheses or a human-edited directives file.

## Operating model

This repository's way of working is modeled explicitly under `operating-model/` (one node
per file: actors, commands, events, policies, read models — grammar in
`operating-model/SCHEMA.md`, catalog in `operating-model/{{CONTEXT}}/model.md`). The crux
plugin's skills carry the lifecycle: `adopt` mines the model from evidence, `observe` traces
sessions against it, `evaluate` audits it, `compile` regenerates executable artifacts from
it, `run` executes compiled flows, `verify` A/B-tests interventions.

- Policy nodes with `enforcement: hook` are enforced by the plugin's generic interpreter
  (deny), and `enforcement: advisory` nodes print one advisory line — the node file IS the
  configuration; no code changes.
- Compiled artifacts open with a header naming their source nodes: never hand-edit one —
  fix the node (or the compiler input) and regenerate.
- Model changes land through evidence (adopted from transcripts/artifacts or verified via
  the experiment loop), never from vibes.
