"""render-case-study.py — the counted per-keep case-study renderer: a pure,
deterministic projection of one pinned kept experiment's artifacts into ONE
plain-language page plus its extraction manifest.

PROVENANCE — COUNTED, byte-preserving port of the kept H-201 fixture renderer
(experiments/runs/H-201/fixture/render_case_study.py in the source lab;
hypothesis H-201-keep-case-study-v2 KEPT 2026-08-28, two consecutive counted
5/5: zero renderer-invented facts against the extraction manifest, the cold
outside reader answered 5/5 discriminating synthesis questions from the page
while the raw-artifacts reader answered strictly fewer, content-law lint clean,
and byte-identical recompilation). Only this provenance framing and the script
name differ from the counted fixture copy.

This file IS the counted reference render: its fact table is written against
one specific pinned keep (the source lab's H-188 review-cadence keep — the
SPEC/F*/RR*/SC* constants below). To render a case study for one of YOUR keeps,
copy this script, repoint those constants at your keep's pinned artifacts, and
keep the Renderer class, the fail-closed self-checks, and the content laws
unchanged — the grammar (scripts/fact_fidelity.py + scripts/content_lint.py +
scripts/jargon.json) is the counted machinery; the constants are the per-keep
configuration.

Contract (spec Hypothesis + Method steps 1/2/6, frozen at fixture build):
  * inputs: ONLY files under --source (the byte-identical pinned copy). No clock, no
    environment, no network — recompiling reproduces the page byte-identically.
  * declared outputs: exactly <out>/case-study.md and <out>/extraction-manifest.json.
    The renderer creates <out> if needed and writes NOTHING else anywhere.
  * every number is extracted from the artifact bytes by anchored regex at render time
    (never hardcoded), and every quote is verified as an exact byte substring of its
    artifact before it is placed — a drifted source fails the render loudly rather than
    rendering an invented fact.
  * every fact line carries a [source: <repo-relative-path>] pointer; the extraction
    manifest records every (kind, value, artifacts) fact placed.
  * self-check: before writing, the renderer runs the SAME frozen fact grammar the
    fidelity leg uses (fact_fidelity.check) plus the content lint (content_lint.lint)
    and refuses to emit a page that fails either — fail-closed at the source.

Content laws carried by the template: content-law voice (plain language), the frozen
jargon list glossed at first use, zero bare slugs, curly double quotes reserved for
artifact quotes, no timestamps, no invented aggregates (per-run figures only — a sum
appears in no artifact of record, so no sum appears here).
