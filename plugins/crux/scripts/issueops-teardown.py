"""IssueOps teardown (counted under H-136-issueops-live-tier1 in the source
lab, kept 2026-08-27, two consecutive counted 5/5 on live GitHub with full
post-teardown restoration verified; shipped as counted from the fixture copy
`teardown_issues.py` — only provenance framing, the script name, and the
audited-helper import differ; usage guide: docs/issueops.md in this plugin).

THE TEARDOWN CONTRACT (frozen with the counted fixture):
  1. Operates ONLY on the issue numbers listed in the given RUN-MANIFEST.json --
     never on any other issue (a repo's pre-existing issues, or anything
     another lane seeds, are untouchable by construction).
  2. Allowed operations, per manifest issue, in order:
       a. remove each harness-applied label (the taxonomy label recorded in
          the manifest), op-class label-remove;
       b. exactly one close-with-pointer: `gh issue close N --comment <pointer>`,
          where <pointer> names the durable run record -- the single comment this
          harness ever writes, carried by the allowlisted close operation itself.
  3. Never: delete, reopen, lock, edit a title or body, comment outside the close,
     or touch repository-level configuration (labels stay defined on the repo; only
     their attachment to the seeded issues is removed).
  4. Best-effort completion: a failure on one issue is recorded and the remaining
     issues are still torn down; exit is nonzero if anything failed, and every
     invocation -- success or failure -- is in the audit log.
  5. Restoration record: after teardown, each seeded issue's state/labels/comments
     are fetched (read op) into post-teardown-issues.json -- the artifact a
     "post-teardown listing" assertion grades (closed, pointer present, harness
     labels gone).

Manifest shape: {"repo": "owner/repo", "taxonomy_label": "<label>",
"issues": {"<role>": {"number": N}, ...}}. Requires CRUX_GH_ACCOUNT (the
per-invocation account pin — see scripts/issueops_gh.py).

Usage:
    issueops-teardown.py --manifest RUN-MANIFEST.json --pointer TEXT
                         --audit-log LOG --out post-teardown-issues.json
