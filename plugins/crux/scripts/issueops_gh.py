"""Audited gh invocation helper for the crux issueops scripts (counted under
H-136-issueops-live-tier1 in the source lab, kept 2026-08-27, two consecutive
counted 5/5 on live GitHub issues; shipped as counted — only provenance
framing and the pinned-account resolution differ from the counted fixture
copy `ghops.py`; usage guide: docs/issueops.md in this plugin).

Every gh/API invocation an issueops script makes -- read or write -- goes
through gh() below and lands as one JSONL row in the audit log, so
outward-write confinement is gradable from the log alone. The op
classification here is FROZEN (the counted allowlist):

    WRITE ops (the outward-write allowlist):
        issue-create           gh issue create ...        (seed time only)
        label-add              gh issue edit --add-label
        label-remove           gh issue edit --remove-label
        close-with-pointer     gh issue close --comment   (teardown only)
    READ ops (everything else these scripts run):
        auth-token, api-read, issue-view, ...

Account pinning (the counted doctrine; machine reality): gh's active-account
state is machine-global and concurrently mutated by other sessions, so the
account is pinned PER-INVOCATION by resolving `gh auth token --user <pinned
account>` once per process and injecting GH_TOKEN into each child's env. The
token value lives only in process memory: it is never written to the audit
log, any artifact, or stdout.

Consumer configuration: set CRUX_GH_ACCOUNT to the gh account these scripts
must pin (the counted fixture hardcoded the source lab's account; a shipped
copy has no account to assume). Unset = every invocation refuses -- pinning
is the doctrine, not an optimization.
