"""compile-dashboard.py -- portable status dashboard for a crux consumer repo.

Compiles DASHBOARD.md at the repo root from the repository's OWN streams:

  1. OPEN DECISIONS AND COMMITMENTS -- ledger rows (JSONL) not yet resolved
     against committed state: a row closes when the [closes-when: ...] bracket
     in its `hit` text is satisfied at HEAD; a row without a valid bracket
     stays open until the ledger line itself is removed or rewritten.
     Rows carry one optional `assignee` (canonical email) and render in three
     buckets: YOURS (assignee canonicalizes to the current identity), OTHERS'
     (assigned to someone else -- always visible, display name resolved), and
     SHARED (no assignee = everyone sees it; absence of routing fails toward
     visibility). Each row's creator is DERIVED from git blame on its ledger
     line -- never stored; a line with no landing commit yet renders with no
     creator segment at all, never a placeholder.
  2. RECENT ACTIVITY -- journal fragments grouped by day, newest first.

Who-am-I: the header carries an `acting as` line -- `git config user.email`
canonicalized through two optional committed maps, the git-native `.mailmap`
and a root-level `contributors.json` ({"<canonical email>": {"name": ...,
"aka": [...]}}). Display names live only in that map; an unmapped email
renders bare with a hint. Both maps are optional (graceful-missing).

Design laws (the intake discipline applied to status):
  - Status is a projection, never an authored document. This script owns every
    byte of DASHBOARD.md: regenerate it, never edit it.
  - The output is COMMITTED content, so it carries no transient values. Any
    fact that is true only at render time is omitted rather than labelled --
    committing a placeholder would freeze a state that has already moved on.
    A cold reader's checkout must mean what it says.
  - Names appear only where they are RESOLVED from the committed maps at render
    time -- the `acting as` line and an assignee. That is the maps doing their
    job, not authored prose, and it is regenerated every session so it cannot
    drift. Nothing else here names a person.
  - Graceful-missing everywhere. A missing ledger file, journal directory, or
    git binary renders as a visible note inside the affected section, never a
    crash. The script never raises; hook mode always exits 0.
  - Deterministic. No wall clock: the header stamp derives from the HEAD commit
    date. The inputs are the repo's streams plus the rendering identity (git
    config user.email, .mailmap, contributors.json, ledger blame); unchanged
    inputs compile to byte-identical output; the write is atomic and happens
    only when bytes differ.

CLI:
    compile-dashboard.py [repo-root]          render; print one summary line
    compile-dashboard.py [repo-root] --quiet  render silently (hook mode)
    compile-dashboard.py [repo-root] --check  no write; exit 0 fresh / 1 stale

Configuration: .claude/crux.json at the repo root (the init skill writes
it). Keys read here: raw_dir (default research/raw), journal_dir (default
experiments/journal-fragments), and ledger_file (default ledger/ledger.jsonl;
optional -- a repo without a ledger simply shows an empty decisions section).

closes-when predicates (evaluated read-only against HEAD, never the worktree):
    path-exists=<path>        the path is tracked at HEAD
    commit-grep=<text>        some commit message contains the text
    hypothesis-kept=<id>      exactly one hypotheses/<id>-*.md tracked at HEAD
                              whose "## Status" block starts with "kept"
    maintainer-ruling=<slug>  a tracked file under the configured raw dir whose
                              name contains both <slug> and "ruling"
    decision-resolved=<id>    an accepted|denied kind:"decision-resolution" row
                              for <id> exists in the configured ledger AT HEAD

v3 decision store (ported from the source lab's compile-dashboard v3, decision kit
2026-08-28; contract: docs/decisions.md). EXACTLY these additions, everything above
unchanged:
  - parse_ledger normalizes THREE row shapes: the legacy {date,slug,hit[,kind,assignee]}
    rows unchanged; v2 {kind,id,date,text[,closes_when][,assignee]} rows (slug := id,
    hit := text + " [closes-when: ...]"); and the decision pair (kind:"decision" /
    kind:"decision-resolution", joined on id at compile time). Malformed counts only
    truly-bad lines.
  - "## 1. DECISIONS WAITING" renders FIRST: one AskUserQuestion-grammar card per open
    decision (chip line, ask:, option checkboxes, other:, why-only-you:, evidence:,
    blocks:, answer: — the section-1 text grammar of docs/decisions.md), plus compat
    cards for open legacy maintainer-ruling rows not shadowed by an open decision. The
    pre-existing sections keep their exact bodies, renumbered 2..3.
  - decided_by / decided_at / resolution_commit are NEVER stored: they derive from the
    git commit that introduced the resolution line (one git log + ~log2(N) git show per
    resolution, run ONLY when resolution rows exist).
  - decisions.html: a SECOND written file at the repo root, regenerated whole from the
    decisions-template.html found in the consumer repo's scripts/ or beside this script
    (template missing => emission skipped, noted in section 1; render never fails on it).
  - the optional DECIDERS routing file (JSONL {"match","owner"}) lives beside the
    configured ledger; rows with no route default to owner "you".
  - ages in section 1 derive from the header stamp (HEAD commit date), never the wall
    clock — the determinism law is unchanged.
  - the compiler NEVER opens anything; scripts/proactive-open.sh belongs to
    decisions.py add/surface alone.
  - --check compares DASHBOARD.md bytes only (they cover every ledger change); an
    edit to the decisions-template alone refreshes decisions.html on the next
    render rather than tripping --check.
