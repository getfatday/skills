"""The resolution reply templater (counted twice in the source lab: under
H-106-issueops-roundtrip, kept 2026-08-15 two consecutive 5/5 on the
file-based transport, and byte-unchanged under H-136-issueops-live-tier1,
kept 2026-08-27 two consecutive counted 5/5 on live GitHub; shipped as
counted from the fixture copy `reply_templater.py` — only provenance framing
and the script name differ; usage guide: docs/issueops.md in this plugin).

The counted outward-comms doctrine this script enforces: replies to a
reporter are ASSEMBLED FROM STRUCTURED FIELDS INTO FIXED TEMPLATES, never
free LLM generation posted to a public surface. Stdlib only (json, re, sys,
pathlib), offline, no free generation. Every field written into a reply JSON
is either passed on argv (itself sourced from a prior deterministic script's
own stdout/exit code -- the converter's REJECT line, preflight's FAIL line)
or read verbatim from an artifact the same pipeline already produced (a
draft's own "## Status" line, a run's own results.json). This script never
invents prose; the calling pipeline supplies any fixed narrative string as a
plain argv value. Emitted replies are STAGED RUN ARTIFACTS — posting one to
a real issue is ladder tier 3, human-gated (docs/issueops.md).

Usage:
    issueops-reply.py resolved  <issue_id> <draft_path> <run2_results_path> <summary> <out_path>
    issueops-reply.py rejected  <issue_id> <field_pointer> <reason> <out_path>
    issueops-reply.py escalated <issue_id> <preflight_check> <detail> <queue_ref> <out_path>

Output is written with sort_keys=True + fixed separators, so byte-identical
inputs (across two independently bootstrapped clones) always produce
byte-identical reply JSON, regardless of any incidental dict/argv ordering.
