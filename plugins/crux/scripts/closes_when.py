"""closes_when.py -- shared closes-when predicate parser + evaluator.

PROVENANCE — port of the source lab's scripts/closes_when.py (H-100 kept lineage;
the decision-resolved predicate joined it with the decision kit, directive
2026-08-28). One predicate evaluator, shared by the session resolver
(hooks/scripts/session_resolver.py) and any consumer sweep, so two readers of the
same ledger can never disagree on open/closed (the split-brain guard). Differences
from the lab copy: the maintainer-ruling directory and the decision-store ledger
path resolve through .claude/crux.json (raw_dir, default research/raw; ledger_file,
default ledger/ledger.jsonl). Predicate semantics are identical.

Grammar (at most one bracket per line, appended to the committing line):

    [closes-when: <predicate>=<argument>]

parsed by:

    \\[closes-when:\\s*(path-exists|commit-grep|hypothesis-kept|maintainer-ruling|decision-resolved)=([^\\]]+)\\]

Unknown predicate or empty argument = malformed. The design treats "malformed" and
"bracket absent" identically -- both are "no valid closes-when" -- so parse_bracket()
returns None for both.

All five predicates are evaluated read-only, against committed (HEAD) state ONLY, never
the working tree: "committed at HEAD" (path-exists), "some commit message" (commit-grep),
"landed as kept ... at HEAD" (hypothesis-kept), "some committed filename" (maintainer-
ruling), "an accepted|denied decision-resolution row in the ledger at HEAD"
(decision-resolved, docs/decisions.md section 4) -- the Durability invariant
("uncommitted work effectively does not exist").

Stdlib + git only. No network. No writes.
